# Split-a-String-Into-the-Max-Number-of-Unique-Substrings

Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.

You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

class Solution:

    def maxUniqueSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        def backtrack(start, seen):
            if start == len(s):
                return 0
            max_splits = 0
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                substring = s[start:end]
                if substring not in seen:
                    seen.add(substring)
                    max_splits = max(max_splits, 1 + backtrack(end, seen))
                    seen.remove(substring)
            return max_splits
        return backtrack(0, set())
